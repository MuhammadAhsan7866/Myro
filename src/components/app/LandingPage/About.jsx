            Many may ask, what is Myro? Myro is the name of the dog owned by Raj
            Gokal, one of the co-founders of Solana. This project pays homage to
            him, and his dog, and responds to the popular demand for dog-based
            narratives in the crypto space. Myro was created in response to this
            demand, and to provide value to the ecosystem created by Raj and his
            partner â€” the Solana blockchain.
          </Text>
          <Text   fontSize={'20px'}fontWeight={'400'} lineHeight={'140%'}>
            Myro is more than just a cryptocurrency, it is also a movement. We
            believe that Solana has the potential to change the world for the
            better, and we are committed to making it more inclusive and
            welcoming for everyone.
